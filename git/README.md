# Practical: git

## Aims

* Familiarising yourself with git concepts and commands

## Background

This week's practical involves working the introductory tutorial for git provided by the Software Carpentry Foundation.

Section 13 of the tutorial talks about alternatives for hosting. I
recommend using github with the Education pack
https://education.github.com/students. The most useful thing it gives
you is unlimited private repositories while you are a student. That
means that you can develop your work securely and in private,
i.e. without accusation of allowing plagiarism, but you can later make
it public.  You don't need private repositories set up for this
practical, but you will need them for later coursework. Many employers
in software development also look favourably on a long and active
history with tools like github. 



## Tasks

1. If you are using your own machine then [install git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git). If you're using a CIS lab machine then you will need to make sure that it is booted into Linux to access the command line, or run git with bash prompt from Windows. For git bash from Windows on a CIS PC you need to first launch Git client via AppsAnywhere, then search for git: Git Bash will be there as an option.

2. Register with [GitHub
   education](https://education.github.com/students) to get a range of
   benefits, including unlimited private repositories. _Choose a
   username that doesn't identify you_ for privacy's sake. (You don't
   need to wait for registration to complete before starting the tutorial.)

3. Using the command line (Terminal in OSX or Linux, command prompt or git bash on Windows), 
 complete the [Software Carpentry git tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) apart from section 14 Supplemental: Using Git from RStudio. If you want to develop your command line skills then (another time) try [UNIX/Linux shell
   tutorial](https://github.com/stevenaeola/proglabs_js/tree/main/shell)

4. If you finish the other tasks you might like to understand more about how git works by reading [git from the bottom up](https://jwiegley.github.io/git-from-the-bottom-up/).
